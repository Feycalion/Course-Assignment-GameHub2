## Description

For this assignment I implemented everything everything I had learned about HTML and CSS so far into the fictional game store website "GameHub".

## Assignment Brief

You must deliver a properly functioning, responsive website.

GameHub is an online shop where users can purchase computer games. This gaming marketplace lets you buy tons of video games online for any device. GameHub is a competitively priced website with a huge range of games.

The key points in this assignment were the following:

- The HTML should be semantic and neat.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap; we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
- The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
- You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by yourself. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, which should be included in your report.

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

## Contact

This is where you can leave your social links for people to contact you, such as a LinkedIn profile or Twitter link e.g.

[My Twitter page](www.twitter.com)

[My LinkedIn page](www.linkedin.com)

## License

You can link to your license file here if you're using one, or mention what license the codebase falls under. If you're unsure then you can simply delete this section.

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can add any acknowledgements if you'd like, such as to people who have helped you or any code snippets you'd like to mention. You can delete this section if you don't have any acknowledgements to make.
